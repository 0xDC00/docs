# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a Text Hooker?

A text hooker is a piece of software that can read and extract text from another process while it is running. They are often used for language learning purposes, but it can be used for other things as well.

### What is Agent used for?

In short, it is used for extracting text from games and processes. It can aid in learning a language, playing a game in another language, etc.

### Why Agent? What's different from Textractor?

Agent isn't a direct Textractor replacement, but it can do things that other text hookers can't, such as hooking emulated and JavaScript-based games.

### Does Agent work with ...?

Each game that is used with Agent requires a specific script. You can check the [scripts repo](https://github.com/0xDC00/scripts) to see if the game you are interested in is supported.

### Can I request a script for ...?

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/0xDC00/scripts/issues) requesting the game you would like a script to be created for.

### Why scripts?

Since we can use JavaScript, we have much more flexibility to customize the hooks for each game, which results in a better end-user experience.

### Does Agent support HCode?

Yes, you can use the `PC HCode` script, which allows you to enter an HCode when attaching to the game. We can also embed HCodes in scripts.

### How do I create a script for a game?

Writing a script for a game will require some programming and debugging/reverse-engineering skills. The [scripts repo](https://github.com/0xDC00/scripts) has many example scripts which you can take a look at to see how other games work. You can also reach out to us on the [#scripting channel](https://discord.com/channels/867944111557201980/888396325345964092) on Discord if you have issues.
